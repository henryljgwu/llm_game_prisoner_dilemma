The payoffs for each round are as follows: if both players cooperate, each receives 3 points; if one player defects while the other cooperates, the defector receives 5 points and the cooperator receives 0 points; if both players defect, each receives 1 point. The total score for each player is the sum of the points from all 3 rounds."
