By not adhering to a consistent pattern, I can keep Lee uncertain about my next move, preventing him from exploiting any predictable behavior. Whether I decide to cooperate or defect in the next round will be entirely random, ensuring that my strategy remains elusive and difficult for Lee to anticipate, thereby maximizing my chances of securing a better payoff.",

Adhering to my strategy of randomness and a non-conventional mindset, I recognize that predictable behaviors might allow Lee to exploit or anticipate my actions. To maintain unpredictability, I may consider occasionally cooperating, even if Lee defects, to introduce uncertainty and potentially disrupt any patterns Lee might attempt to establish. This approach aims to maximize my own outcomes by keeping Lee guessing and preventing any straightforward exploitation.",
            "Lee": "The last round was fascinating. Both Jordan and I chose to defect, resulting in minimal gains for both of us. This predictability might be something I can exploit. For the next round, I could continue defecting to ensure I don't get taken advantage of, or perhaps throw Jordan off by cooperating, forcing them to reconsider their strategy against me. Being unpredictable could give me an edge in maximizing my total score over the remaining rounds."
